## Docs

[SDK documentation can be found here (beta)](https://microting.github.io/eform-sdk-documentation/?csharp#)

## Examples, demonstrating different use cases.

Several examples can be found in the Program.cs file:
* method Sample1 : Used for simple work orders, a work order is generated and an eForm is send to one device, when the device returns the result, the eForm is no longer visible on the device.
* method Sample2 : Used for letting multiple people receive the same work order, but only use the first returned. An eForm is send to several devices, when one device returns a result, the eForm is no longer visible on that device, and results from other devices are stored, but marked as retracted.
* method Sample3 : Used for ordering a service and let handlers bit on being the handler. An ordering eForm is send to several devices. One devices returns a result with an order, this sends out eForm's to handlers, the first handler to accept, will receive the order. The winning handler gets the next eForm. The loosing handlers gets information about they didn't win. And those who didn't bit will have their eForm's retracted.
